# BasicJSProject

This project showcases a simple project where users can enter text, select a position, and then display that text within one of four available colored block spaces.

### Files:

1. **index.html**: This HTML file provides the structure for the project. It includes a text input field where users can enter text. Buttons are provided for selecting a position from the four colored blocks where text can be displayed.

2. **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the project, including the appearance of the colored blocks and the layout of the user interface.

3. **script.js**: The JavaScript file handles user interactions and dynamically updates the content of the colored blocks based on user input. It contains functions for adding text, deleting text, and moving text to different colored blocks. Event listeners are used to respond to button clicks and user input.
